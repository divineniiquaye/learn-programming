* Add a new **"main"** tag which should be styled with a top/down margin of 0px, left/right margin as auto and a max width of 640px
* In the body of the **main** tag, include a **h1** tag with text not more than 30 words.
* Next create three paragraphs:

  - The second paragraph should contain an image with the link https://picsum.photos/id/257/2560/1440.jpg and an alternative title.
