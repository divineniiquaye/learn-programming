# Learning Web Development

Welcome to a task based curriculum which is all about JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. The lessons taught here can take you 1 - 12 week depending on your learning pace.

In this curriculum we do not seek to learn the basics, but how we can apply the basics to building something beautiful and useful.

Each task includes written instructions to complete the lesson, a solution, an assignment and more, tasks are ranked from alower difficulty (eg: `task_1`) to a much higher difficulty (eg: `task_100`).

Web development is very broad subject for learning, so it is required you have prior knowledge of JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. Our task-based pedagogy is aimed at you improving while building projects to become a better and skilled developer.

In addition, each solution provided for each task with the intention of flexible learning curve, will provide you a pleased learning experience, fun and retention that can be taken in whole or in part. The projects start small and become increasingly complex.
