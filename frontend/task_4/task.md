## 🚀 Challenge

* Change the text in the **h1** tag to **My Goals for the Year**.
* After the first paragraph-level thematic break, create a nav area with an unordered list with links to:
  - The first anchor link should have a href of **#lean** and text of **Learning HTML**
  - The second and last anchor link should have a href of **#vacation** and text of **Planning a Vacation**
* The anchored links should be styled with the following:
  - Text should have a default color of aliceblue.
  - After the link has been visited, it should change to color of lightgray.
  - When the link is hovered or active, it should have a hex color of **eee**.
  - This should be done in your external stylesheet so it becomes global for all pages if used.
* Move the contents in the second paragraph beneath it and leave out the **Let me tell you how:** text.
* Wrap each new line as list in an ordered list. Remove the line breaks and spaces.
* Wrap the content between the second and third paragraph-level thematic break in a **section** tag with id of **learn**.
* Do same for the content between the third and last paragraph-level thematic break in a **section** tag with id of **vacation**.
* Wrap the last copyright text in an anchored tag in a paragraph linking to an about page.
* Before we create a new file **about.html** for our about page, let's add more details to the last **h3** tag and it's paragraph which is before the last paragraph-level thematic break.
* Change the **Place** text to **Places** in the **h3** tag.
* Next, to the paragraph beneath, change it to a description list maintaining the content in the paragraph as the first list.
* Create a new file **about.html**, the head of the webpage should be similar to the **index.html**, but change the text of it's title and description.
* In the body of the webpage, add a greeting with your name next to it. It should be wrapped in a **h1** tag.
* Add a paragraph-level thematic break, then beneath it add a paragraph describing yourself.
* Add a paragraph-level thematic break, this time you have to create an unordered list of four:
  - The first should start with the text **Download**, followed by an anchor link to download the favicon image used in this webpage.
  - The second should start with the text **Contact me at**, followed by an anchor link to your email address.
  - The third should start with the text **Dial**, followed by an anchor link to a phone number.
  - Lastly, an anchor link to a blank page with opens **https://google.com**.
* Add the last paragraph-level thematic break, followed by same copyright notice used in the **index.html** page.
* Finally, add an anchor link to the **index.html** page wrapped in a paragraph with text **Back to Home**.
