# Task: Practice your HTML - Part 1

In this lesson, we're going to use HTML to layout the 'skeleton' of a simple web interface.

## 📍Get Started

On your computer, create a folder called 'simple-page-1' and inside it, a file called 'index.html'. Open folder or file in any editor of your choice (VS Code recommended), just make sure to hand-code the HTML markup.

## 🚀 Challenge

* The webpage should be titled **My First Web Page**.
* The background color of the webpage should be dark gray.
* The default text font size should be 22px and coloured **whitesmoke**.
* The body of the webpage should contain two column of text:
  -  **Hello World!** should be wrapped in a h1 tag.
  -  A paragraph which reads **This is my first web page.**.
* The css provided for the webpage should be embedded.

> GOOD LUCK 😀
