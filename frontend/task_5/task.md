# Task: Practice your HTML - Part 5

This lesson will not be much detailed, you are expected to change the 'skeleton' of the webpages to match that in the `/solution` given.

## 📍Get Started

On your computer, copy the previous folder called 'simple-page-4' to a new folder 'simple-page-5'. Open the folder in any editor of your choice (VS Code recommended).

## 🚀 Challenge

* Open the `solution` folder for this task in a new window of your text editor.
* Observe the changes made to the pages and apply them to yours.
* Recopy the `simple-page-4' content into your `simple-page-5` folder and try again doing the changes yourself at least twice.
* In the next tasks, we'll focus on styling. So you're expected to style the **index.html** and **about.html** page to the best of your abilities. Do it at least twice.

> GOOD LUCK 😀
